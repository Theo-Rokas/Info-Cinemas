                The Matrix is a 1999 American science fiction action film[3][4] written and directed by the
                Wachowskis.[a] It stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe
                Pantoliano and is the first installment in the Matrix franchise. It depicts a dystopian future in which
                humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality, the Matrix, created by intelligent machines
                to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source.[5] When computer programmer Thomas
                Anderson, under the hacker alias "Neo", uncovers the truth, he "is drawn into a rebellion against the
                machines"[5] along with other people who have been freed from the Matrix.
