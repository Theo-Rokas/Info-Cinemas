        The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the
        DC
        Comics character Batman, the film is the second installment of Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy and a sequel to
        2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale and supported by Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron
        Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Morgan Freeman. In the film, Bruce Wayne / Batman (Bale), Police Lieutenant
        James
        Gordon (Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart) form an alliance to dismantle organized crime in
        Gotham City, but are menaced by an anarchistic mastermind known as the Joker (Ledger), who seeks to undermine
        Batman's influence and throw the city into anarchy.
