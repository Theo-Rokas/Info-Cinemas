                Inception is a 2010 science fiction action film[4][5][6] written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who
                also produced the film with his wife, Emma Thomas. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional
                thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. He is offered a chance to
                have his criminal history erased as payment for the implantation of another person's idea into a
                target's subconscious.[7] The ensemble cast includes Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion
                Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.
